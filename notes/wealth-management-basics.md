## Core Framework & Process

### Client-First Mindset
- Fiduciary spirit: **client interests first**, fully informed, transparent, documented.
- Behavioral coaching > product selection. You are a **process manager**.

### The 7-D Process (overview)
1. **Discover** (goals, values, constraints)
2. **Data** (statements, budgets, tax returns)
3. **Diagnose** (gaps, risks, priorities)
4. **Design** (plan, IPS, portfolio)
5. **Deliver** (explain, educate, obtain consent)
6. **Do** (implement, automate, rebalance)
7. **Debrief** (reviews, reporting, iterate)

### Planning Pyramid
- Base: **Cash flow, emergency fund, insurance, debts**
- Middle: **Tax-advantaged savings & diversified portfolio**
- Top: **Goals (retirement, education, real estate), estate, advanced tax**

<!-- TODO: Add your own diagram link or ASCII sketch -->

## Compliance & Ethics (Canada)

> [!TIP]
> Keep this section general. Put **specific rules/limits** in a separate annually updated page and link to it from here.

### Core Duties
- **KYC** (Know Your Client): collect/refresh profile, objectives, risk tolerance/capacity, constraints.
- **KYP** (Know Your Product): features, risks, costs, suitability vs. alternatives.
- **Suitability & Client-Focused Reforms**: document rationale for all recommendations.
- **Conflicts & Disclosure**: identify, control, and **document** mitigation.
- **Privacy**: store and share data per policy; obtain consents; secure transmission.

### Documentation You Always Keep
- Discovery notes, signed IPS, proposals, cost/fee disclosures, trade rationales, review agendas & minutes.

### Red-Flag Triggers (hold & escalate)
- Sudden risk-seeking trades inconsistent with IPS, vulnerable client indicators, incomplete KYC, or suspected fraud.

---

## Client Discovery & IPS

### Discovery (what to uncover)
- **Goals** (timelines, $ targets, must-haves vs nice-to-haves)
- **Cash flows** (income stability, savings rate), **balance sheet** (assets, debts)
- **Risk**: tolerance (psychological), **capacity** (financial), **need** (required return)
- **Constraints**: time horizon, liquidity needs, tax, legal, unique preferences (ESG, screens)

### Build the IPS (Investment Policy Statement)
- Purpose & scope  
- Roles & responsibilities  
- Risk profile (tolerance/capacity)  
- Strategic asset allocation & ranges  
- Selection criteria (ETFs, funds, individual securities)  
- Rebalancing policy (thresholds / bands)  
- Monitoring, reporting, and review cadence

<!-- TODO: Paste signed IPS template into Appendix and link it here -->

---

## Cash Flow & Safety Net

### Core Objectives
- Positive **savings rate** aligned to goals.
- **Emergency fund** sized to job stability and dependents.
- **Debt plan**: prioritize high-cost debt; match amortization to asset life.
- Automation: pay-yourself-first, bill syncing to pay cycles.

### Practical Checks
- [ ] Spending categorized (fixed, variable, discretionary)  
- [ ] Annual big-ticket calendar (taxes, insurance, travel)  
- [ ] Debt inventory with rates/terms and pay-down plan

---

## Investing Essentials

### Asset Classes & Roles
- **Equities** (growth), **Fixed income** (stability/income), **Cash** (liquidity), **Alts** (diversifiers; complexity).

### Core Principles
- Diversification, low costs, taxes matter, time in market > timing, behavior discipline.

### Key Metrics (formulas you’ll re-use)
- **CAGR**: \[(Ending/Beginning)^(1/Years) − 1\]  
- **Volatility**: std. dev. of periodic returns  
- **Sharpe (ex-post)**: (Return − Risk-free) / Volatility  
- **Max Drawdown**: min(rolling peak-to-trough)

<!-- TODO: Link to your spreadsheet or Python notebook implementing these -->

---

## Portfolio Construction & Tax Awareness

### From Plan to Portfolio
- **Strategic allocation** (long-term), **Tactical** (rare, bounded), **Core-satellite** (broad core, focused satellites).
- **Rebalancing**: calendar (e.g., semi-annual) plus **bands** (e.g., ±20% of asset-class weight or ±2–5 pts). Document it.

### Tax Location (Canada-focused, keep numbers elsewhere)
- **Registered** (RRSP/LIRA/RRIF, TFSA, FHSA, RESP, RDSP) vs **taxable** accounts.
- General idea: place the most **tax-inefficient** income where tax is deferred/ sheltered **when appropriate** given client constraints.

### Withdrawal Coordination (high level)
- Sequence across registered/taxable to manage brackets, benefits, and longevity risk—**document rationale**.

---

## Registered Accounts (Canada Primer)

> Keep detailed **limits/phase-outs** on a separate “202X Limits” page and update annually.

### High-Level Roles
- **RRSP**: tax-deferred growth; contributions deductible; withdrawals taxable (future tax planning needed).
- **TFSA**: tax-free growth/withdrawals; contribution room accumulates; flexible for goals.
- **FHSA**: first-home savings with deduction + tax-free qualified withdrawal (time-boxed account).
- **RESP**: education savings with federal grants; plan for EAP withdrawals.
- **RDSP**: disability savings with grants/bonds; specific eligibility rules.

<!-- TODO: Add links to your annually updated limits page -->

---

## Retirement Planning & Decumulation

### Key Concepts
- **Target income** (needs/wants/gifts), **longevity risk**, **sequence risk**.
- **Pension/benefits** (CPP/OAS), employer pensions, personal accounts (RRSP/TFSA/non-reg).
- **Withdrawal rulesets**: fixed %, guardrails, floor-and-upside, annuity blends.

### Stress-Testing
- Historical, Monte Carlo, and **what-if** (bad first 5 years, inflation spikes). Document results in review pack.

---

## Insurance & Risk Management

### Protect the Plan
- **Life**, **Disability**, **Critical Illness**, **Liability/Umbrella**, **Property/Auto**, **Health**.
- Coverage sizing ideas: income replacement, debt payoff, education funding, legacy wishes.

### Practical Steps
- [ ] Policy inventory with owners/beneficiaries  
- [ ] Gap analysis vs needs  
- [ ] Annual review on renewal

---

## Estate & Legacy

### Essentials
- **Will**, **Powers of Attorney** (property & personal care), **beneficiary designations**, guardianship, digital assets plan.
- Coordinate with legal/tax pros; align account titling and beneficiaries with the plan.

---

## Practice Operations (CRM, cadence, templates)

### Cadence
- **Initial** (discovery → plan → implementation).  
- **Review**: at least annually; also life-event or drift/rebalance triggers.

### Hygiene
- Standard file names (YYYY-MM-DD_topic), searchable notes, email templates, task checklists.

### Meeting Pack (what to include)
- Performance & progress to goals, risk review, cash-flow check, tax actions, action items with owners/dates.

---

## Skill-Building Roadmap

### Technical (weekly reps)
- **Spreadsheets** (returns, drawdowns, glidepaths), **Python/R** (backtests, reports), **Power BI** (dashboards).
- **Tax literacy** (read CRA guides annually), **product due diligence** (prospectus/ETF factsheets).

### Communication
- Plain-language explanations, one-page summaries, visual aids, **behavioral coaching** scripts.

### Drills (check off as you go)
- [ ] Write a 1-page IPS for a sample client  
- [ ] Build a rebalancing memo using your template  
- [ ] Run a 30-year retirement stress test and summarize in 150 words  
- [ ] Explain TFSA vs RRSP trade-offs in plain English

---

## Glossary

### Core Terms
- **Risk capacity**: ability to absorb losses without derailing goals.  
- **Risk tolerance**: comfort with volatility/drawdowns.  
- **Sequence risk**: order of returns affecting outcomes during withdrawals.
