# Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF): What It Is and How to Invest
![What is an ETF?](/assets/images/what-is-an-etf-infographic.jpg)


## What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)?
- An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds multiple underlying assets and can be bought and sold on an exchange, much like an individual stock. 
- ETFs can be structured to track anything from the **price of a commodity** to a **large and diverse collection of stocks**, even specific investment strategies. 
- Various ETFs are available to investors for **income generation**, **speculation**, or **hedging risk** in an investor’s portfolio. 
> The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index.
