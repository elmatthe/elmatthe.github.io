summary: When to contribute to each account in Canada.

**Rule of thumb:** If your *current* marginal tax rate is lower than your *future* expected rate, use a **TFSA** first; if it’s higher now than later, prioritize **RRSP**.

- **TFSA**: tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **RRSP**: tax deduction now; taxed on withdrawal later.
