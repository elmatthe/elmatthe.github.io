# Elijah's Wealth Management GitHub Pages (Starter)

This is a minimal skeleton you can upload to your `USERNAME.github.io` repo.

## What it gives you
- A clean landing page + top navigation (Projects, Scripts, Notes, About)
- Folders you can drop content into
- Simple templates for adding new notes, projects, and scripts

## How to use
1) Upload everything in this folder to the root of your `USERNAME.github.io` repository.
2) Commit and push. GitHub Pages will build automatically.
3) Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io` to see it live.

## Add new content (quick recipe)
- Notes (Q&A style): duplicate `notes/_template.md`, rename it, edit front matter and content.
- Projects (case studies): duplicate `projects/_template.md`, rename, edit.
- Scripts (code): duplicate `scripts/_template.md`, rename, paste code blocks.

Tip: Keep file names lowercase-with-dashes. Images can go in `assets/uploads/` and be linked like `![alt text](/assets/uploads/your-image.png)`.
